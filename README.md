## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🧠 Customized EEPROM

A manually designed EEPROM logic simulation to understand memory storage and retrieval operations at the hardware level.

- Simulates read/write operations.
- Demonstrates how data is stored and accessed using address and control logic.
- Useful for understanding internal EEPROM structure without using built-in ICs.

### 2. 🌫️ Air Pollution Meter

A simulation of an air quality monitoring system using gas sensors and microcontroller input.

- Simulates gas sensor data like CO₂ or CO levels.
- Displays real-time air quality on an LCD display.
- Can be adapted for practical IoT-based pollution tracking.

### 3. 🔐 Fingerprint-Based Door Lock System

A security system that allows access only to verified fingerprints.

- Simulates a fingerprint module (mocked for Proteus) with microcontroller logic.
- Displays access status (Granted/Denied) on an LCD.
- Controls servo motor to lock/unlock a door based on identity verification.

### 4. 💧 Water Level Monitor & Controller

Automated water tank level management using level sensors and relays.

- Simulates water level detection via discrete sensors.
- Activates or deactivates pump motors based on water level.
- Includes LED indicators or LCD feedback for current tank status.
